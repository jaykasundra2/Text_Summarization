# Text_Summarization
There are two main approaches to summarizing text documents; they are:

1. Extractive Methods.
2. Abstractive Methods.

Extractive text summarization involves the selection of phrases and sentences from the source document to make up the new summary. Techniques involve ranking the relevance of phrases in order to choose only those most relevant to the meaning of the source.

Abstractive text summarization involves generating entirely new phrases and sentences to capture the meaning of the source document. This is a more challenging approach, but is also the approach ultimately used by humans. Classical methods operate by selecting and compressing content from the source document.
